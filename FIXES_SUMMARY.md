# Quick Summary - Both Issues Fixed ✅

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Control Center System Configuration Empty ❌ → ✅
**Before:** Just placeholder text saying "System configuration will be integrated here..."

**After:** Beautiful dashboard with 4 color-coded cards showing:
- 🔵 Alert System status (enabled/disabled, threshold, cooldown)
- 🟢 Email Recipients (count + list of emails)
- 🟡 Rate Limiting (global limit + info)
- 🔵 Cache System (status + TTL)

Plus action buttons to configure settings and test alerts!

### Issue 2: Email Recipients Auto-Including Admins ❌ → ✅
**Before:** Site administrators automatically received critical alerts (unwanted)

**After:** ONLY manually configured email addresses receive alerts
- No automatic admin inclusion
- Full manual control
- Clear documentation
