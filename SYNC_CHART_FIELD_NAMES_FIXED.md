# ✅ Sync Chart Field Names Fixed - CRITICAL BUG

## Issue Discovered
**Problem:** Chart showed flat line even after populating 5 fresh records
**Root Cause:** Wrong field names - code was looking for fields that don't exist!

## The Bug

### What the Code Was Looking For:
```php
// WRONG - These fields don't exist!
timecreated
timemodified
```

### What the Table Actually Has:
```xml
<!-- From install.xml -->
<FIELD NAME="created_at" ... />
<FIELD NAME="updated_at" ... />
```

**The code was checking `if (isset($table_info['timecreated']))` which always returned FALSE, so no data was ever queried!**

## Files Fixed

### File Modified
- `local/local_alx_report_api/monitoring_dashboard_new.php`

### Sections Fixed

#### 1. Metric Cards (Top of Page)
**Before:**
```php
if (isset($table_info['timecreated'])) {
    $records_created = $DB->count_records_select('local_alx_api_reporting', 
        'timecreated >= ?', [$today_start]);
}
```

**After:**
```php
if (isset($table_info['created_at'])) {
    $records_created = $DB->count_records_select('local_alx_api_reporting', 
        'created_at >= ?', [$today_start]);
}
```

#### 2. Sync Trends Chart (Blue Line - Created)
**Before:**
```php
if (isset($table_info['timecreated'])) {
    $count = $DB->count_records_select('local_alx_api_reporting',
        'timecreated >= ? AND timecreated < ?',
        [$hour_start, $hour_end]
    );
}
```

**After:**
```php
if (isset($table_info['created_at'])) {
    $count = $DB->count_records_select('local_alx_api_reporting',
        'created_at >= ? AND created_at < ?',
        [$hour_start, $hour_end]
    );
}
```

#### 3. Sync Trends Chart (Green Line - Updated)
**Before:**
```php
if (isset($table_info['timemodified']) && isset($table_info['timecreated'])) {
    $count = $DB->count_records_select('local_alx_api_reporting',
        'timemodified >= ? AND timemodified < ? AND timecreated < ?',
        [$hour_start, $hour_end, $hour_start]
    );
}
```

**After:**
```php
if (isset($table_info['updated_at']) && isset($table_info['created_at'])) {
    $count = $DB->count_records_select('local_alx_api_reporting',
        'updated_at >= ? AND updated_at < ? AND created_at < ?',
        [$hour_start, $hour_end, $hour_start]
    );
}
```

#### 4. Company Sync Status Table
**Before:**
```php
// Created today
if (isset($table_info['timecreated'])) {
    $created_today = $DB->count_records_select('local_alx_api_reporting', 
        'companyid = ? AND timecreated >= ?', [$company->id, $today_start]);
}

// Updated today
if (isset($table_info['timemodified'])) {
    $updated_today = $DB->count_records_select('local_alx_api_reporting', 
        'companyid = ? AND timemodified >= ? AND timecreated < ?', 
        [$company->id, $today_start, $today_start]);
}

// Last sync
if (isset($table_info['timemodified'])) {
    $last_record = $DB->get_record_sql(
        "SELECT MAX(timemodified) as last_time ...",
        [$company->id]
    );
}
```

**After:**
```php
// Created today
if (isset($table_info['created_at'])) {
    $created_today = $DB->count_records_select('local_alx_api_reporting', 
        'companyid = ? AND created_at >= ?', [$company->id, $today_start]);
}

// Updated today
if (isset($table_info['updated_at'])) {
    $updated_today = $DB->count_records_select('local_alx_api_reporting', 
        'companyid = ? AND updated_at >= ? AND created_at < ?', 
        [$company->id, $today_start, $today_start]);
}

// Last sync
if (isset($table_info['updated_at'])) {
    $last_record = $DB->get_record_sql(
        "SELECT MAX(updated_at) as last_time ...",
        [$company->id]
    );
}
```

## Why This Happened

### Moodle Standard vs Custom Fields

**Moodle Standard Fields:**
- `timecreated` - Standard Moodle convention
- `timemodified` - Standard Moodle convention

**Your Table Uses:**
- `created_at` - Custom naming (more modern/Laravel-style)
- `updated_at` - Custom naming (more modern/Laravel-style)

The code was written assuming Moodle standard field names, but your table schema uses custom names.

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ Chart always showed flat line (0 data)
- ❌ Metric cards showed 0 created/updated
- ❌ Company table showed 0 created/updated today
- ❌ Last sync time was "Never"

### After Fix
- ✅ Chart shows real spikes when you populate
- ✅ Metric cards show actual counts
- ✅ Company table shows real activity
- ✅ Last sync time displays correctly

## Testing

### Your Test Case
**What you did:**
- Deleted all data
- Populated test company
- Created 5 records at 13:14:40

**What should happen now:**
1. **Metric Cards:**
   - Records Created: 5
   - Records Updated: 0

2. **Sync Trends Chart:**
   - Blue line spike at 13:00 hour: +5

3. **Company Table:**
   - test company: Created Today = 5

## All Fixed Locations

| Location | Field Changed | Lines |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Metric Card - Created | `timecreated` → `created_at` | ~505 |
| Metric Card - Updated | `timemodified` → `updated_at` | ~515 |
| Chart - Created Line | `timecreated` → `created_at` | ~1220 |
| Chart - Updated Line | `timemodified` → `updated_at` | ~1250 |
| Company Table - Created | `timecreated` → `created_at` | ~600 |
| Company Table - Updated | `timemodified` → `updated_at` | ~605 |
| Company Table - Last Sync | `timemodified` → `updated_at` | ~615 |

## Status

✅ **All field names corrected**
✅ **Chart will now show real data**
✅ **Metric cards will show real counts**
✅ **Company table will show real activity**
✅ **No syntax errors**

## Next Steps

1. **Refresh the page** - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Check the chart** - Should see spike at 13:00
3. **Check metric cards** - Should show 5 created
4. **Check company table** - Should show 5 for test company

**Date:** 2025-10-09
**Issue:** Chart not showing data despite fresh population
**Root Cause:** Wrong field names (timecreated vs created_at)
**Solution:** Changed all references to use correct field names
**Status:** ✅ Fixed - Ready to test
