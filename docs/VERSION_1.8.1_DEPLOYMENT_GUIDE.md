- **No breaking changes** - Fully backward compatible
- **No configuration needed** - Works immediately after upgrade
- **Cache safe** - Respects cache settings

---

## 📊 Expected Results

After upgrade:
- Manual sync will show "Records Updated: X" when user profiles change
- Auto sync will detect user profile changes every 15 minutes
- Reporting table will stay up-to-date with user information

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If sync doesn't detect changes:
1. Verify version is 1.8.1 (2024101600)
2. Check that user's `timemodified` field was updated in Moodle
3. Ensure cutoff time includes the change (default: last 7 days)
4. Check Moodle error logs for any SQL errors

### If upgrade fails:
1. Restore backup: `cp -r local/local_alx_report_api_backup_1.8.0 local/local_alx_report_api`
2. Check file permissions
3. Review Moodle error logs
4. Contact support

## 📞 Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check version: **Site Administration → Plugins → Local plugins**
2. Review error logs: **Site Administration → Reports → Logs**
3. Test with manual sync first before relying on auto sync
