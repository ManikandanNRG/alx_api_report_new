# CRITICAL FIX: API Logging Function Restored ✅

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED

### Problem:
- API calls were working and returning data ✅
- BUT API calls were NOT being logged to database ❌
- Control Center showed "0 API calls today" ❌
- Monitoring Dashboard showed "0 API calls" ❌

### Root Cause:
The function `local_alx_report_api_log_api_call()` was **missing from lib.php**!

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS FIXED

### Added Missing Function:
**File**: `local/local_alx_report_api/lib.php`  
**Function**: `local_alx_report_api_log_api_call()`  
**Lines Added**: ~45 lines

### Function Purpose:
Logs every API call to the `local_alx_api_logs` table with:
- User ID
- Company shortname
- Endpoint called
- Record count returned
- Error message (if any)
- Response time
- IP address
- User agent
- Additional data (JSON)

---

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION

### Function Added to lib.php:

```php
function local_alx_report_api_log_api_call($userid, $company_shortname, $endpoint, 
    $record_count = 0, $error_message = null, $response_time_ms = null, $additional_data = []) {
    global $DB;

    try {
        if (!$DB->get_manager()->table_exists(\local_alx_report_api\constants::TABLE_LOGS)) {
            return;
        }

        $log = new stdClass();
        $log->userid = $userid;
        $log->company_shortname = $company_shortname;
        $log->endpoint = $endpoint;
        $log->record_count = $record_count;
        $log->error_message = $error_message;
        $log->response_time_ms = $response_time_ms;
        $log->timecreated = time(); // FIXED: Use timecreated (not timeaccessed)
        $log->ip_address = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] ?? 'unknown';
        $log->user_agent = substr($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] ?? 'unknown', 0, 255);

        if (!empty($additional_data)) {
            $log->additional_data = json_encode($additional_data);
        }

        $DB->insert_record(\local_alx_report_api\constants::TABLE_LOGS, $log);

    } catch (Exception $e) {
        error_log("ALX Report API: Failed to log API call: " . $e->getMessage());
    }
}
```

### Key Fix:
Changed `$log->timeaccessed = time();` to `$log->timecreated = time();` to match Bug #2 field rename.

---

## 📊 IMPACT

### Before Fix:
- ❌ API calls not logged
- ❌ Control Center shows 0 calls
- ❌ Monitoring Dashboard shows 0 calls
- ❌ No usage statistics
- ❌ No performance metrics
- ❌ No security monitoring

### After Fix:
- ✅ API calls logged correctly
- ✅ Control Center shows real call count
- ✅ Monitoring Dashboard shows real metrics
- ✅ Usage statistics available
- ✅ Performance metrics tracked
- ✅ Security monitoring works

---

## 🧪 HOW TO TEST

### Test Steps:
1. Make an API call (any endpoint)
2. Refresh Control Center page
3. Check "API Calls Today" metric
4. Should show 1 (or more) instead of 0

### Expected Results:
```
Before API call: API Calls Today = 0
After API call:  API Calls Today = 1 ✅
After 2nd call:  API Calls Today = 2 ✅
```

---

## 🔍 WHY THIS HAPPENED

### Timeline:
1. Original code had `local_alx_report_api_log_api_call()` function
2. Bug #2 fix changed field names (`timeaccessed` → `timecreated`)
3. Function was accidentally removed (possibly during merge or cleanup)
4. API continued working (function call in finally block didn't crash)
5. But logging silently failed (function didn't exist)

### Lesson:
- Always verify function dependencies after major changes
- Test all functionality after field renames
- Check that logging actually works (not just that API returns data)

---

## ✅ QUALITY CHECKS

- [x] Function added to lib.php
- [x] Uses correct field name (timecreated)
- [x] Uses table constant (TABLE_LOGS)
- [x] Proper error handling
- [x] No syntax errors
- [x] Backward compatible
- [x] Ready for testing

---

## 📁 FILES MODIFIED

- `local/local_alx_report_api/lib.php` (+45 lines)
  - Added `local_alx_report_api_log_api_call()` function

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. ✅ Function restored
2. [ ] Test API call
3. [ ] Verify logging works
4. [ ] Check Control Center shows correct count
5. [ ] Check Monitoring Dashboard shows metrics

---

## ✅ CONCLUSION

**Critical logging function has been restored!**

API calls will now be properly logged and tracked in:
- Control Center dashboard
- Monitoring Dashboard
- Security monitoring
- Performance metrics

**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Ready for Testing
