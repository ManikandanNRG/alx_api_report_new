# Email Alert System Fix - COMPLETE ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Issue:** Rate limit violations not sending email alerts  
**Status:** FIXED

---

## 🔍 THE PROBLEM

The email alert system was **partially implemented**:

### What Was Working:
✅ Alerts table exists  
✅ Rate limit violations create alerts in the alerts table (externallib.php line 252-267)  
✅ Scheduled task runs every 15 minutes  
✅ Email settings configured in settings.php  
✅ Email sending functions exist in lib.php  
✅ Test email works (test_email_alert.php)  

### What Was Broken:
❌ **The scheduled task was NOT processing alerts from the alerts table!**  
❌ `local_alx_report_api_check_and_alert()` only checked for NEW violations  
❌ Existing alerts in the alerts table were never emailed  

---

## 🎯 THE ROOT CAUSE

**File:** `local/local_alx_report_api/lib.php`  
**Function:** `local_alx_report_api_check_and_alert()` (line 2571)

The function was doing this:
1. Query logs for rate limit violations → Create NEW alerts
2. Check system health → Create NEW alerts
3. Check API usage → Create NEW alerts

**But it was NOT doing this:**
1. ❌ Query the alerts table for unresolved alerts
2. ❌ Send emails for existing alerts
3. ❌ Mark alerts as resolved after sending

---

## ✅ THE FIX

Updated `local_alx_report_api_check_and_alert()` to:

### PRIORITY 1: Process Existing Alerts (NEW!)
```php
// Get unresolved alerts from alerts table
$unresolved_alerts = $DB->get_records_sql(
    "SELECT * FROM {alerts} 
     WHERE resolved = 0 
     AND severity IN (allowed_severities)
     ORDER BY timecreated ASC"
);

// For each alert:
foreach ($unresolved_alerts as $alert) {
    // 1. Check cooldown period
    if (!in_cooldown) {
        // 2. Get recipients
        $recipients = get_alert_recipients();
        
        // 3. Send email to each recipient
        foreach ($recipients as $recipient) {
            send_email_alert($recipient, $alert);
        }
        
        // 4. Mark alert as resolved
        $alert->resolved = 1;
        $alert->timeresolved = time();
        $DB->update_record('alerts', $alert);
    }
}
```

### PRIORITY 2: Check for NEW Violations (Existing)
- Rate limit monitoring
- System health checks
- API usage monitoring
- Security alerts

---

## 🔄 THE COMPLETE FLOW NOW

### When Rate Limit is Exceeded:
1. **externallib.php** (line 252-267):
   - Creates alert in alerts table
   - Sets `resolved = 0`
   - Stores alert_type, severity, message, hostname

### Every 15 Minutes (Scheduled Task):
2. **check_alerts_task.php**:
   - Runs `local_alx_report_api_check_and_alert()`

3. **lib.php** `check_and_alert()`:
   - ✅ **NEW:** Queries alerts table for unresolved alerts
   - ✅ **NEW:** Filters by severity threshold (from settings)
   - ✅ **NEW:** Checks cooldown period
   - ✅ **NEW:** Sends email to configured recipients
   - ✅ **NEW:** Marks alert as resolved
   - Then checks for NEW violations (existing behavior)

### Email Sent:
4. **lib.php** `send_email_alert()`:
   - Formats professional email
   - Includes alert details
   - Adds link to Control Center
   - Uses Moodle's email_to_user()

---

## 🧪 TESTING

### To Test the Fix:

1. **Trigger a rate limit violation:**
   - Make API calls exceeding the daily limit
   - Alert should be created in alerts table

2. **Wait for scheduled task (or run manually):**
   ```bash
   php admin/cli/scheduled_task.php --execute='\local_alx_report_api\task\check_alerts_task'
   ```

3. **Check results:**
   - Email should be sent to configured recipients
   - Alert should be marked as resolved in database
   - Check mtrace output for confirmation

### Expected Output:
```
ALX Report API: Starting alert check...
Found 1 unresolved alerts to process
Sent alert email to admin@example.com for rate_limit_exceeded
Marked alert ID 123 as resolved
ALX Report API: Alert check completed.
```

## ⚙️ SETTINGS USED

The fix respects all existing settings:

- **enable_alerting** - Master switch for alert system
- **enable_email_alerts** - Enable/disable email sending
- **alert_threshold** - Minimum severity (low/medium/high/critical)
- **alert_emails** - Comma-separated recipient list
- **alert_cooldown** - Minutes between same alert type (prevents spam)

---

## 📊 IMPACT

### Before Fix:
- Alerts created ✅
- Alerts visible in Control Center ✅
- **NO emails sent** ❌

### After Fix:
- Alerts created ✅
- Alerts visible in Control Center ✅
- **Emails sent automatically** ✅
- Alerts marked as resolved ✅
- Cooldown prevents spam ✅

The email alert system is now **fully functional**:
- Alerts are created when violations occur
