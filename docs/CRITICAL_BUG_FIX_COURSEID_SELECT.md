# CRITICAL BUG FIX - Missing courseid in SELECT Statement

**Date:** 2025-10-13  
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🐛 Bug Description

**Error:** "Population error: Error writing to database"

**Root Cause:** When optimizing SQL queries in Phase 3, we removed `c.id as courseid` from the SELECT statement. However, the code NEEDS `$record->courseid` to insert/update records in the reporting table.

---

## ❌ What Went Wrong

### Phase 3 Optimization (INCORRECT)

We removed `c.id as courseid` from SELECT statements thinking it was wasteful:

```php
// WRONG - Missing courseid
SELECT DISTINCT
    u.id as userid,
    u.firstname,
    u.lastname,
    u.email,
    u.username,
    c.fullname as coursename,  // ❌ Missing c.id as courseid
    ...
```

### Why This Caused an Error

The code tries to insert/update records using `$record->courseid`:

```php
$reporting_record->courseid = $record->courseid;  // ❌ $record->courseid is NULL!
```

Since `courseid` wasn't in the SELECT, `$record->courseid` was undefined/NULL, causing database insert to fail because:
1. `courseid` is a required field (NOT NULL)
2. `courseid` is part of the unique key `(userid, courseid, companyid)`

---

## ✅ The Fix

### Corrected SQL Queries

**File:** `local/local_alx_report_api/lib.php`

**Function 1:** `local_alx_report_api_populate_reporting_table()`

```php
// CORRECT - Include courseid in SELECT
SELECT DISTINCT
    u.id as userid,
    u.firstname,
    u.lastname,
    u.email,
    u.username,
    c.id as courseid,          // ✅ ADDED BACK - Needed for database insert
    c.fullname as coursename,
    ...
```

**Function 2:** `local_alx_report_api_update_reporting_record()`

```php
// CORRECT - Include courseid in SELECT
SELECT DISTINCT
    u.id as userid,
    u.firstname,
    u.lastname,
    u.email,
    u.username,
    c.id as courseid,          // ✅ ADDED BACK - Needed for database insert
    c.fullname as coursename,
    ...
```

---

## 🔍 Why We Need courseid in SELECT

### 1. **Database Insert/Update**
```php
$reporting_record->courseid = $record->courseid;  // ✅ Now works
```

### 2. **Unique Key Constraint**
```sql
UNIQUE KEY (userid, courseid, companyid)  -- courseid is required
```

### 3. **Record Lookup**
```php
$existing = $DB->get_record(TABLE_REPORTING, [
    'userid' => $record->userid,
    'courseid' => $record->courseid,  // ✅ Needed to find existing record
    'companyid' => $company->id
]);
```

## 📊 What's Different from Phase 3

### Phase 3 Goal (Still Valid)
Remove wasteful `c.id as courseid` from queries where we DON'T use it.

### Where We Correctly Removed It
✅ **externallib.php** - Fallback query that builds API response
- We don't return courseid in API response
- We don't need it for any logic
- Correctly removed

### Where We INCORRECTLY Removed It
❌ **lib.php** - Data population queries
- We DO need courseid for database operations
- We DO need it for unique key lookups
- Should NOT have been removed

---

## 🎯 Correct Understanding

### SELECT courseid - When to Include

**Include courseid in SELECT when:**
- ✅ Inserting/updating records that need courseid field
- ✅ Looking up records by courseid
- ✅ Using courseid in application logic

**Exclude courseid from SELECT when:**
- ✅ Building API response (we return username instead)
- ✅ courseid is only used in WHERE/ORDER BY/JOIN clauses
- ✅ courseid is not needed in the result set

### Example: Correct vs Incorrect

**CORRECT (externallib.php - API response):**
```php
// Don't need courseid in result - only for filtering
SELECT u.id, u.username, c.fullname as coursename
FROM {user} u
JOIN {course} c ON c.id = e.courseid  // ✅ Use in JOIN
WHERE courseid IN (...)               // ✅ Use in WHERE
ORDER BY courseid                     // ✅ Use in ORDER BY
// ✅ courseid not in SELECT - we don't use it in the result
```

**CORRECT (lib.php - Data population):**
```php
// Need courseid in result - for database insert
SELECT u.id, u.username, c.id as courseid, c.fullname as coursename
FROM {user} u
JOIN {course} c ON c.id = e.courseid
// ✅ courseid in SELECT - we use it to insert into database
```

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### If You Already Deployed v1.7.0

1. **Update lib.php** with the fixed version
2. **Clear Moodle cache:**
   ```bash
   php admin/cli/purge_caches.php
   ```
3. **Truncate and repopulate reporting table:**
   ```sql
   TRUNCATE TABLE mdl_local_alx_api_reporting;
   ```
4. **Run populate again** from the UI or CLI

### If You Haven't Deployed Yet

1. **Use the fixed version** of lib.php
2. **Deploy normally** following the deployment checklist

---

## ✅ Verification

### Test the Fix

1. **Go to Populate Reporting Table page**
2. **Click "Populate Now"**
3. **Verify:**
   - ✅ No "Error writing to database" error
   - ✅ Records are inserted successfully
   - ✅ Count shows records processed and inserted

### Check Database

```sql
-- Verify records have courseid populated
SELECT userid, courseid, username, coursename 
FROM mdl_local_alx_api_reporting 
LIMIT 10;

-- All records should have courseid values
SELECT COUNT(*) as total,
       COUNT(courseid) as with_courseid,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN courseid IS NULL THEN 1 END) as null_courseid
FROM mdl_local_alx_api_reporting;
```

**Expected:** `null_courseid` should be 0

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### 1. **Be Careful with Optimizations**
- Removing fields from SELECT seems simple
- But must verify the field isn't used downstream
- Always trace through the entire code path

### 2. **Test After Each Change**
- Should have tested populate after Phase 3
- Would have caught this immediately
- Always test critical paths after optimization

### 3. **Understand the Difference**
- **API Response Queries:** Can remove courseid (not returned to client)
- **Data Population Queries:** Must keep courseid (needed for database operations)

### 4. **Document Assumptions**
- Should have documented why we removed courseid
- Should have noted where it's still needed
- Better documentation prevents mistakes

## 📞 Summary

**What happened:** Removed `c.id as courseid` from SELECT in lib.php functions  
**Why it broke:** Code needs `$record->courseid` to insert into database  
**How we fixed it:** Added `c.id as courseid` back to SELECT in lib.php  
**Lesson learned:** Distinguish between API queries and data population queries  

**The fix is simple, tested, and ready to deploy!**
