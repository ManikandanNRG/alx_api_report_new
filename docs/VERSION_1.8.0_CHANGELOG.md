- Faster response to problems

### Documentation:
- `docs/EMAIL_ALERT_FIX_COMPLETE.md`
- `docs/EMAIL_ALERT_SYSTEM_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md`

## ‚úÖ 2. INCREMENTAL SYNC IMPLEMENTATION

**Issue:** Manual sync "Sync Recent Changes" was processing ALL records instead of only recent changes  
**Status:** FIXED ‚úÖ

### What Was Fixed:
- Created new function `local_alx_report_api_sync_recent_changes()`
- Queries only records modified within the lookback period
- Much faster and more efficient than full population
- Properly uses the `$hours_back` parameter

### Performance Improvement:
- **Before:** Processed 3,313 records in ~25 seconds
- **After:** Processes only changed records in ~1-2 seconds
- **Speed:** 10-25x faster! ‚ö°

### Files Modified:
- `lib.php` - Added `sync_recent_changes()` function (~150 lines)
- `sync_reporting_data.php` - Updated to call new function

### Impact:
- Immediate sync after making changes
- No waiting for scheduled task
- Efficient processing of only changed data

### Documentation:
- `docs/SYNC_RECENT_CHANGES_FIX_COMPLETE.md`
- `docs/SYNC_REPORTING_DATA_ANALYSIS.md`

---

## ‚úÖ 3. DUPLICATE SYNC PREVENTION

**Issue:** Running sync multiple times processed the same records repeatedly  
**Status:** FIXED ‚úÖ

### What Was Fixed:
- Added checks to skip records already synced within lookback period
- Queries now check `last_updated` field in reporting table
- Each change processed exactly once
- No more duplicate processing

### Example:
```
Before:
9:26 AM - Sync ‚Üí 3 users updated
9:46 AM - Sync ‚Üí 3 users updated AGAIN ‚ùå

After:
9:26 AM - Sync ‚Üí 3 users updated
9:46 AM - Sync ‚Üí 0 users updated ‚úÖ
```

### Files Modified:
- `lib.php` - Updated 3 SQL queries in `sync_recent_changes()`

### Impact:
- More efficient (no wasted processing)
- Accurate statistics (shows real changes)
- Can run sync as often as needed

### Documentation:
- `docs/SYNC_DUPLICATE_PREVENTION_FIX.md`

---

## ‚úÖ 4. CLEANUP RESULTS ENHANCEMENT

**Issue:** Cleanup orphaned records only showed debug output, no user-friendly results  
**Status:** FIXED ‚úÖ

### What Was Fixed:
- Added comprehensive results display for cleanup action
- Shows company information, statistics, affected users, courses
- Professional design matching sync results
- Detailed breakdown of what was cleaned

### New Display Includes:
- Company Information Card
- Cleanup Statistics Card
- Deleted Records by Company Table
- Affected Courses Table
- Affected Users Table (with names and emails)
- Clean Database Message (when no orphans found)

### Files Modified:
- `sync_reporting_data.php` - Enhanced cleanup section (~150 lines)

### Impact:
- Clear visibility of cleanup actions
- Audit trail of deleted records
- Professional user experience

### Documentation:
- `docs/CLEANUP_ORPHANED_RECORDS_ENHANCEMENT.md`

---

## ‚úÖ 5. BATCH SIZE TEXT CLARIFICATION

**Issue:** Users confused about batch size behavior (expected 1000 total, got all records)  
**Status:** FIXED ‚úÖ

### What Was Fixed:
- Updated help text to clarify batch size means "per batch" not "total limit"
- Added example showing how batching works
- Updated both web UI and CLI help text

### New Text:
```
Number of records to process per batch. The system will 
process ALL records in batches of this size to avoid 
memory issues. Larger batches are faster but use more memory.

Example: 3,313 records with batch size 1000 = 4 batches 
(1000+1000+1000+313)
```

### Files Modified:
- `populate_reporting_table.php` - Updated help text (2 lines)

### Impact:
- No more confusion about batch size
- Users understand what will happen
- Clear expectations

### Documentation:
- `docs/BATCH_SIZE_TEXT_UPDATE_COMPLETE.md`
- `docs/BATCH_SIZE_ISSUE_ANALYSIS.md`
