# Monitoring Dashboard Bug #2 Fix

## Date: 2025-10-10

## Problem
The monitoring_dashboard_new.php page was showing "Error reading from database" with a Continue button. The error was caused by undefined `$table_info` variable being used in multiple locations.

## Root Cause
The `$table_info` variable was defined at line 70 inside an `if` block for top-level stats, but was being used in other sections without being redefined:

1. **Performance Tab - Company Loop (line 739)**: Used `$table_info['response_time_ms']` without defining `$table_info`
2. **Performance Tab - Company Loop (line 771)**: Used `$table_info['error_message']` without defining `$table_info`
3. **Security Section (line 138)**: Used `$table_info['error_message']` without defining `$table_info`

This caused PHP errors when trying to access array keys on an undefined variable.

## Solution
Added `$table_info = $DB->get_columns('local_alx_api_logs');` in each section where it's needed:

### Fix #1: Performance Tab - Company Loop
**Location**: Line ~733
**Added**:
```php
// Get table structure to check for optional fields
$table_info = $DB->get_columns('local_alx_api_logs');
```

### Fix #2: Security Section
**Location**: Line ~110
**Added**:
```php
// Get table structure to check for optional fields
$table_info = $DB->get_columns('local_alx_api_logs');
```

### Already Correct: Auto-Sync Tab
The auto-sync company loop already had `$table_info = $DB->get_columns('local_alx_api_reporting');` defined at line 585, so no fix was needed there.

## Testing
1. ✅ No syntax errors detected by getDiagnostics
2. ✅ All `$table_info` usages now have proper definitions in scope
3. ✅ File uses standard Moodle field names (timecreated, timemodified) throughout

## Files Modified
- `local/local_alx_report_api/monitoring_dashboard_new.php`

## Next Steps
1. Upload the fixed file to the server
2. Reload monitoring_dashboard_new.php
3. Verify all tabs work correctly
4. Verify no database errors appear
