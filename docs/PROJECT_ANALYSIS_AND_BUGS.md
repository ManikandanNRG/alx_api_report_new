## 🐛 IDENTIFIED BUGS & INCONSISTENCIES

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS

**Rate Limit "Issue" (Issue #7):** Originally listed as a bug, but this is actually **working as designed**. The system intentionally logs rate limit violations for monitoring and security purposes while still blocking the requests. This is industry standard practice and enables proper security monitoring and business intelligence.

### CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Today)

#### 1. **Missing Error Handling in API Endpoint**
**File:** `externallib.php`  
**Issue:** No try-catch blocks or proper error handling
**Impact:** API crashes instead of returning proper error messages
**Evidence:** No `throw new moodle_exception` or error handling found in grep search

**Fix Required:**
```php
// Add proper error handling wrapper
try {
    // API logic
} catch (Exception $e) {
    return [
        'success' => false,
        'error' => $e->getMessage(),
        'data' => []
    ];
}
```

---

#### 2. **Inconsistent Field Names in Database**
**File:** `db/install.xml` vs actual usage  
**Issue:** Schema uses `timeaccessed` but code checks for both `timeaccessed` and `timecreated`
**Impact:** Confusion and potential bugs when querying logs
**Evidence:** 
- install.xml line 10: `timeaccessed` field
- lib.php line 165: Checks for both fields with fallback

**Fix Required:** Standardize on one field name across all code

---

#### 3. **Company Shortname vs Company ID Inconsistency**
**File:** `local_alx_api_logs` table  
**Issue:** Table has `company_shortname` field but some code expects `companyid`
**Impact:** Queries fail or return no data
**Evidence:** lib.php lines 180-195 check for both fields

**Fix Required:** 
- Either add `companyid` field back to logs table
- OR update all code to use `company_shortname` consistently

---

#### 4. **Service Name Confusion**
**File:** `db/services.php` and token validation  
**Issue:** Code checks for both 'alx_report_api_custom' and 'alx_report_api' service names
**Impact:** Token validation may fail depending on which service name was used
**Evidence:** lib.php lines 105-115

**Fix Required:** Standardize on ONE service name

---

#### 5. **Missing Validation in Control Center**
**File:** `control_center.php`  
**Issue:** No validation that required tables exist before querying
**Impact:** PHP errors if tables are missing
**Evidence:** Lines 50-70 query tables without checking existence first

**Fix Required:** Add table existence checks before all queries

---

### HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

#### 6. **Cache Key Generation Not Unique Enough**
**Issue:** Cache key doesn't include all relevant parameters
**Impact:** Different API calls might get same cached data
**Current:** `api_response_{companyid}_{limit}_{offset}_{sync_mode}`
**Missing:** Token hash, field filters, course filters

**Fix Required:** Include all parameters that affect response

---

#### 7. **~~Rate Limiting Not Enforced Properly~~** ✅ NOT A BUG - WORKING AS DESIGNED
**Status:** This is intentional design for monitoring purposes
**How it works:** 
- Requests beyond the limit ARE blocked (no data returned)
- BUT violations ARE logged for monitoring and security tracking
- This allows the monitoring dashboard to show violation counts and patterns

**Why this is correct:**
- Industry standard practice (GitHub, AWS, Stripe all do this)
- Enables security monitoring (detect abuse attempts)
- Provides business intelligence (which companies need higher limits)
- Helps debugging (clients can see their usage history)

**Enhancement Opportunity:** Add per-company rate limits (see separate spec)

---

#### 8. **Sync Task Has No Timeout Protection**
**Issue:** Hourly sync could run indefinitely
**Impact:** Multiple sync tasks could overlap and cause database locks
**Evidence:** No execution time tracking or timeout in sync task

**Fix Required:** Add max execution time and prevent overlapping runs

---

#### 9. **Email Alert System Not Fully Configured**
**Issue:** Alert task exists but email sending not implemented
**Impact:** Admins don't receive alerts even when enabled
**Evidence:** check_alerts_task.php only calls checking function, no email sending

**Fix Required:** Implement actual email sending in alert system

---

#### 10. **Monitoring Dashboard Shows Placeholder Data**
**Issue:** Some metrics show hardcoded or estimated values
**Impact:** Misleading information for admins
**Evidence:** monitoring_dashboard.php line 100: `$db_performance['avg_processing_time'] = $db_performance['query_response_time'] * 0.3;`

**Fix Required:** Calculate real metrics from actual data

---

### MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

#### 11. **No Pagination Validation**
**Issue:** API accepts any limit/offset values without validation
**Impact:** Could cause memory issues with huge limit values
**Fix:** Add max limit (e.g., 1000 records per request)

---

#### 12. **Soft Delete Not Fully Implemented**
**Issue:** `is_deleted` field exists but no UI to manage deleted records
**Impact:** Deleted records accumulate in database
**Fix:** Add cleanup task or UI to permanently delete old records

---

#### 13. **No API Version Control**
**Issue:** API has no version number in endpoint
**Impact:** Breaking changes would affect all clients
**Fix:** Add version to API endpoint (e.g., /api/v1/course_progress)

---

#### 14. **Missing Index on Critical Queries**
**Issue:** Some frequently queried fields lack indexes
**Impact:** Slow query performance as data grows
**Fix:** Add composite indexes for common query patterns

---

#### 15. **No Request Logging for Failed Requests**
**Issue:** Only successful requests are logged
**Impact:** Can't debug failed API calls
**Fix:** Log all requests including failures

---

### LOW PRIORITY / POLISH ISSUES

#### 16. **Inconsistent Code Comments**
**Issue:** Some files have detailed comments, others minimal
**Fix:** Standardize documentation style

---

#### 17. **Multiple Backup Files in Production**
**Issue:** *_backup.php files should not be in production
**Fix:** Remove backup files or move to separate directory

---

#### 18. **Debug Files in Production Code**
**Issue:** debug_*.php and test_*.php files in main plugin
**Fix:** Move to separate /dev or /tools directory

---

#### 19. **CSS Files Not Minified**
**Issue:** Large CSS files slow page load
**Fix:** Minify CSS for production

---

#### 20. **No API Documentation Page**
**Issue:** No built-in API documentation for developers
**Fix:** Add interactive API docs page (like Swagger)

---

## 🎯 FUNCTIONAL ISSUES

### Issues That Affect User Experience

#### 21. **Control Center Loads Slowly**
**Issue:** Queries all data on page load
**Fix:** Use AJAX to load data progressively

---

#### 22. **No Loading Indicators**
**Issue:** Users don't know if actions are processing
**Fix:** Add spinners/progress bars for async operations

---

#### 23. **Error Messages Not User-Friendly**
**Issue:** Technical error messages shown to users
**Fix:** Translate technical errors to user-friendly messages

---

#### 24. **No Bulk Actions**
**Issue:** Can't perform actions on multiple items at once
**Fix:** Add checkboxes and bulk action dropdown

---

#### 25. **No Export Functionality**
**Issue:** Can't export monitoring data or logs
**Fix:** Add CSV/Excel export buttons

---

## 🔒 SECURITY CONCERNS

#### 26. **Token Stored in Plain Text**
**Issue:** API tokens visible in database
**Severity:** Medium (Moodle standard, but still a concern)
**Fix:** Consider token hashing or encryption

---

#### 27. **No IP Whitelisting**
**Issue:** API accessible from any IP
**Fix:** Add optional IP whitelist feature

---

#### 28. **No Request Signature Validation**
**Issue:** Tokens could be intercepted and reused
**Fix:** Add HMAC signature validation

---

#### 29. **CORS Headers Not Configured**
**Issue:** Cross-origin requests might fail
**Fix:** Add proper CORS configuration

---

#### 30. **No SQL Injection Protection Audit**
**Issue:** Haven't verified all queries use parameterized statements
**Fix:** Audit all database queries for SQL injection vulnerabilities

---

## 📈 PERFORMANCE ISSUES

#### 31. **No Query Result Caching**
**Issue:** Same queries run multiple times per page load
**Fix:** Implement query result caching

---

#### 32. **N+1 Query Problem**
**Issue:** Loading companies in loop causes multiple queries
**Fix:** Use batch loading or JOIN queries

---

#### 33. **Large JSON Responses Not Compressed**
**Issue:** API responses not gzipped
**Fix:** Enable gzip compression for API responses

---

#### 34. **No Database Connection Pooling**
**Issue:** Each request creates new DB connection
**Fix:** Use Moodle's connection pooling properly

---

#### 35. **Reporting Table Not Partitioned**
**Issue:** Single large table will slow down as data grows
**Fix:** Consider table partitioning by company or date

---
