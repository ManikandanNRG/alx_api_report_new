# Batch Size Fix - Emergency Rollback

**Date**: 2025-10-14  
**Status**: ⚠️ ROLLED BACK - Site Restored  
**Issue**: 500 Error after adding populate function

---

## 🚨 What Happened

1. User reported batch size not working (3,313 records instead of 1,000)
2. Investigation found `local_alx_report_api_populate_reporting_table()` function was missing
3. I added the function to lib.php
4. This caused a 500 error
5. **ROLLBACK**: Restored lib.php from backup

---

## ✅ Site Status

**Current Status**: ✅ SITE WORKING (restored from backup)

The site is now back to its previous state using:
```
local/local_alx_report_api/backup/lib.php.backup_before_error_handling
```

---

## 🔍 Root Cause of 500 Error

The 500 error was likely caused by one of these issues:

1. **Incomplete function closure** - The `get_service_status()` function may not have been properly closed
2. **Syntax error** - PHP syntax issue in the added code
3. **Missing dependencies** - The function called other functions that don't exist
4. **Database compatibility** - SQL syntax not compatible with the Moodle database driver

---

## 📋 Current Situation

**The Problem Remains:**
- Batch size parameter is still being ignored
- The function `local_alx_report_api_populate_reporting_table()` does NOT exist
- When user sets batch size to 1000, all 3,313 records are processed

**Why It's Not Working:**
The populate_reporting_table.php file calls:
```php
$result = local_alx_report_api_populate_reporting_table($company_id, $batch_size, true);
```

But this function doesn't exist anywhere in the codebase!

## 🎯 Next Steps (Safer Approach)

### Option 1: Find the Original Function (RECOMMENDED)

The user mentioned the function existed before and was working. We need to:

1. Check if there's a Git history or older backup
2. Look in archived files for the original implementation
3. Ask the user if they have the original working version

### Option 2: Implement Inline (SAFER)

Instead of adding to lib.php, implement the logic directly in populate_reporting_table.php:

```php
// In populate_reporting_table.php, around line 420
// Instead of calling the function, implement inline:

if (in_array(0, $companies_to_process)) {
    // Process all companies
    $companies = $DB->get_records('company', null, '', 'id, name, shortname');
    
    foreach ($companies as $company) {
        // Get users with LIMIT
        $sql = "SELECT u.id, u.username, u.firstname, u.lastname, u.email
                FROM {user} u
                JOIN {company_users} cu ON cu.userid = u.id
                WHERE cu.companyid = ?
                AND u.deleted = 0";
        
        $users = $DB->get_records_sql($sql, [$company->id], 0, $batch_size);
        
        // Process users...
        foreach ($users as $user) {
            // Get enrollments and insert records
        }
    }
}
```

### Option 3: Create Separate File (SAFEST)

Create a new file `local/local_alx_report_api/classes/populate_helper.php`:

```php
<?php
namespace local_alx_report_api;

class populate_helper {
    public static function populate_reporting_table($companyid, $batch_size, $verbose) {
        // Implementation here
    }
}
```

Then call it from populate_reporting_table.php:
```php
use local_alx_report_api\populate_helper;
$result = populate_helper::populate_reporting_table($company_id, $batch_size, true);
```

## ⚠️ Why Adding to lib.php Failed

Possible reasons:

1. **File was incomplete** - The truncation at line 4324 may have cut off a function
2. **Syntax error** - Despite diagnostics showing no errors, runtime error occurred
3. **Namespace issues** - The constants class usage may have caused issues
4. **Database driver** - The SQL syntax may not work with all Moodle database drivers

## 📝 Recommendations

**Immediate Action:**
1. ✅ Site is restored and working
2. ❌ Batch size feature still broken
3. ⏸️ Need safer implementation approach

**Best Path Forward:**
1. Ask user for original working version of the function
2. Or implement inline in populate_reporting_table.php (safer)
3. Or create separate class file (safest)
4. Test thoroughly before deployment

---

## 🔧 Temporary Workaround

Until the batch size is fixed, users can:

1. **Process in smaller batches manually**:
   - Select 1 company
   - Run populate
   - It will process all records (can't limit yet)
   - But at least it's one company at a time

2. **Use database query directly**:
   - Manually limit records in database
   - Then run populate

3. **Wait for proper fix**:
   - We need the original function or a safer implementation

---

## ✅ Summary

**Status**: Site restored, batch size still broken

**What Works**: Everything except batch size limiting

**What Doesn't Work**: Batch size parameter is ignored

**Next Step**: Need original function or implement safer alternative

**Priority**: Medium (feature broken but site working)

---

**User**: Please check if you have:
1. Git history with the original function
2. Older backup with working populate function
3. Any documentation about how it worked before

This will help us restore the proper functionality safely!
