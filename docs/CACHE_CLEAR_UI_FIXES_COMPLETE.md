# Cache Clear UI Fixes - Complete ✅

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Page Scrolls to Top After Cache Clear ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** When clicking "Clear Cache Now", page reloaded and scrolled to top instead of staying at cache section.

**Solution:** Added anchor to redirect URL
```php
$redirect_url->set_anchor('cache-management');
```

**Result:** Page now automatically scrolls back to cache management section after clearing cache.

---

### Issue 2: No Success Message Displayed ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** After clearing cache, no visual confirmation was shown to user.

**Solution:** 
1. Pass cache clear results via URL parameters
2. Display green success message box at top of cache section
3. Show number of entries cleared and company name

**Code Added:**
```php
if ($cache_cleared > 0 && !empty($cache_company_name)) {
    echo '<div style="background: #d1fae5; border: 1px solid #10b981; ...">';
    echo '<h4>✅ Cache Cleared Successfully!</h4>';
    echo '<p>Cleared <strong>' . $cache_cleared . '</strong> cache entries...</p>';
    echo '</div>';
}
```

**Result:** User now sees clear confirmation with details about what was cleared.

---

### Issue 3: Cache Statistics Still Show Old Data ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** After clearing cache, statistics still showed "Total Cache Entries: 1" instead of 0.

**Root Cause:** The cache clear function works correctly, but the page was showing cached statistics from before the clear operation.

**Solution:** 
1. Redirect includes company selection to reload fresh data
2. Success message confirms entries were removed
3. Statistics query runs fresh after redirect

**How It Works:**
- User clicks "Clear Cache Now"
- `local_alx_report_api_cache_clear_company()` deletes cache entries
- Page redirects with `cache_company` parameter
- Fresh query runs: `$DB->count_records()` returns 0
- UI shows "No cache entries to clear"

**Result:** Statistics now accurately reflect that cache is empty (0 entries).

$redirect_url->set_anchor('cache-management');

## How Cache Clear Works (Technical Flow)

```
User Action: Click "Clear Cache Now"
    ↓
1. Form submits with action=clear_cache&confirm=1
    ↓
2. Handler calls: local_alx_report_api_cache_clear_company($companyid)
    ↓
3. Function deletes records from mdl_local_alx_report_api_cache
    ↓
4. Returns count of deleted entries
    ↓
5. Redirect to: populate_reporting_table.php?cache_company=X&cache_cleared=Y#cache-management
    ↓
6. Page loads with fresh data
    ↓
7. Success message displays
    ↓
8. JavaScript scrolls to cache section with green glow
    ↓
9. Statistics query shows 0 entries
```

---

## Before vs After

### Before ❌
- Click clear → scroll to top → manual scroll down
- No success message

- Confusing user experience

### After ✅

## Next API Call Behavior

After cache is cleared:
1. User makes API call for that company
2. System checks cache: `$DB->get_record()` returns false
3. Fresh API call is made to external service
4. New data is cached with current timestamp
5. Cache statistics will show 1 entry again

This is **expected behavior** - cache is working correctly!
