# Chart Display Issue - FIXED ✅

## Problem
After removing duplicate functions from `control_center.php`, the three charts in the dashboard cards stopped displaying.

## Root Cause
The chart initialization code was present and correct, but there was a **missing closing `</script>` tag** at the end of the second `DOMContentLoaded` event listener. This caused the JavaScript to not execute properly.

### The Three Charts
1. **API Performance Chart** (`api-performance-chart`) - Line chart showing API calls over 24 hours
2. **Sync Company Chart** (`sync-company-chart`) - Bar chart showing records per company
3. **Security Score Chart** (`security-score-chart`) - Doughnut chart showing security score

## What Was Fixed
**File:** `local/local_alx_report_api/control_center.php`

**Line 2738-2742:** Added missing closing script tag

### Before (Broken):
```javascript
        }, 100); // Small delay to ensure page is fully loaded
    }
// Duplicate functions removed - updateFieldStates() and disableField() are defined earlier in the file
<?php
echo $OUTPUT->footer();
?>
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
        }, 100); // Small delay to ensure page is fully loaded
    }
});
</script>

<?php
echo $OUTPUT->footer();
?>
```

## Chart Initialization Flow
1. **Chart.js CDN** loaded (line 2405)
2. **Chart functions defined** (lines 2407-2679):
   - `initializeCharts()` - Main initialization function
   - `createAPIPerformanceChart()` - Creates line chart
   - `createSyncModeChart()` - Creates bar chart
   - `createSecurityScoreChart()` - Creates doughnut chart
3. **DOMContentLoaded listener** (line 2681) - Calls `initializeCharts()` on page load

## Verification
- ✅ No PHP syntax errors
- ✅ Proper script tag closure
- ✅ Chart initialization code intact
- ✅ All three chart functions present

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
1. Load the Control Center page
2. Check browser console for "All charts initialized successfully"
3. Verify all three cards display their respective charts:
   - API Status card (purple gradient) - Line chart
   - Sync Status card (pink gradient) - Bar chart
   - Performance Status card (teal gradient) - Doughnut chart
