## 🚀 Next Steps (Phase 2 - Future)

When ready, Phase 2 will add actual calculations:

1. **Rate Limited API**: Show "3/3" (companies with limit / total companies)
2. **Valid Tokens**: Show "5/5" (active tokens / total tokens)
3. **REST API Access Control**: Keep as "Enabled" (already clear)

Phase 2 will require:
- Adding company counting logic
- Adding token counting logic
- Proper error handling for null values
- Testing each calculation separately

---
