## 🎯 Changes Made

### Card Title & Subtitle:
```
BEFORE: Performance Status
        API security and access control

AFTER:  Security Health Monitor
        Real-time security monitoring and access control
```

### Metric 1: Rate Limited API
```
BEFORE: Rate Limiting: Active

AFTER:  📊 Rate Limited API: 3/3 ✅
        (Companies with rate limit configured)
```

**Calculation:**
- Counts companies with `rate_limit` setting configured
- Shows ratio: companies_with_limit / total_companies
- Color coded: Green (100%), Yellow (50-99%), Red (<50%)

### Metric 2: Valid Tokens
```
BEFORE: Token Security: Secure

AFTER:  🔑 Valid Tokens: 5/5 ✅
        (Active tokens / Total tokens)
```

**Calculation:**
- Counts active tokens vs total tokens
- Active = not expired (validuntil > now)
- Color coded: Green (100%), Yellow (80-99%), Red (<80%)

### Metric 3: REST API Access Control
```
BEFORE: Access Control: Enabled

AFTER:  🔐 REST API Access Control: Enabled ✅
        (Web services status)
```

**Calculation:**
- Checks if web services are enabled
- Shows: Enabled (green) or Disabled (red)

## 📊 Visual Design

Each metric is displayed in a clean box:
- White background with subtle border
- Icon + Label + Value on same line
- Small subtitle in parentheses
- Color-coded status (green/yellow/red)
- Status icon (✅/⚠️/❌)

**No progress bars** - keeps design clean and different from first card
