## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Backup (CRITICAL)
```bash
# Backup database
mysqldump -u username -p database_name > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Backup current plugin files
tar -czf alx_report_api_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).tar.gz local/local_alx_report_api/
```
- [ ] Database backup completed
- [ ] Plugin files backup completed
- [ ] Backups stored in safe location

### Step 2: Deploy Code
```bash
# Copy updated files to Moodle installation
cp -r local/local_alx_report_api /path/to/moodle/local/
```
- [ ] Files copied to production
- [ ] File permissions verified
- [ ] Ownership set correctly

### Step 3: Run Upgrade
1. Navigate to: **Site Administration → Notifications**
2. Click **Upgrade Moodle database now**
3. Monitor upgrade process
4. Verify no errors

- [ ] Upgrade page accessed
- [ ] Upgrade completed successfully
- [ ] Version 2024101301 confirmed
- [ ] No errors in upgrade log

### Step 4: Verify Database
```sql
-- Check username field exists
DESCRIBE mdl_local_alx_api_reporting;

-- Verify username data populated
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records,
       COUNT(username) as records_with_username,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN username IS NULL OR username = '' THEN 1 END) as empty_username
FROM mdl_local_alx_api_reporting;

-- Sample data check
SELECT userid, username, courseid, coursename 
FROM mdl_local_alx_api_reporting 
LIMIT 10;
```
- [ ] Username field exists
- [ ] Username data populated
- [ ] No NULL or empty usernames
- [ ] Sample data looks correct

### Step 5: Test API Response
```bash
# Test API call
curl -X POST https://your-moodle-site/webservice/rest/server.php \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "wsfunction": "local_alx_report_api_get_course_progress",
    "moodlewsrestformat": "json"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "userid": 123,
      "username": "johndoe",  // ✅ Should be present
      "firstname": "John",
      "lastname": "Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "coursename": "Math 101",
      "percentage": 85.5,
      "status": "completed"
      // courseid should NOT be present ✅
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "limit": 100,
  "offset": 0
}
```

- [ ] API responds successfully
- [ ] Response includes `username` field
- [ ] Response does NOT include `courseid` field
- [ ] Data is accurate
- [ ] No errors in response

### Step 6: Test UI
1. Navigate to: **Site Administration → Plugins → Local plugins → ALX Report API → Company Settings**

3. Check Field Controls section

- [ ] Company Settings page loads
- [ ] "Username" checkbox is displayed
- [ ] "Course ID" checkbox is NOT displayed
- [ ] Can check/uncheck Username field
- [ ] Settings save successfully
- [ ] Settings persist after reload

### Step 7: Test Field Control
1. Uncheck "Username" field in Company Settings
2. Save settings
3. Make API call
4. Verify username is NOT in response
5. Re-check "Username" field
6. Save settings
7. Make API call
8. Verify username IS in response

- [ ] Unchecking removes username from API
- [ ] Checking adds username to API
- [ ] Field control works correctly

### Step 8: Test Sync Operations

# Test manual sync
php admin/cli/scheduled_task.php --execute='\local_alx_report_api\task\sync_reporting_data_task'
```

- [ ] Auto sync works correctly
- [ ] Manual sync works correctly
- [ ] Populate reporting table works
- [ ] Username populated in all cases
- [ ] No errors in sync logs

```sql
-- Check query performance
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM mdl_local_alx_api_reporting 
WHERE companyid = 1 AND courseid IN (1,2,3,4,5)
ORDER BY userid, courseid
LIMIT 100;
```

- [ ] Queries use indexes
- [ ] Response time acceptable
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] Database load normal

### Step 10: Monitor Logs
```bash
# Check Moodle error logs
tail -f /path/to/moodle/error.log

# Check web server logs
tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log  # or nginx
```

- [ ] No PHP errors
- [ ] No database errors
