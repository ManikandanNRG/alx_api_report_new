# API Logging Duplicate Function Fix - CRITICAL

## Issue Identified
Found duplicate `local_alx_report_api_log_api_call()` functions in `lib.php` with inconsistent field names:

1. **First function (line ~2938)**: Used `timeaccessed` field (INCORRECT)
2. **Second function (line ~4430)**: Used `timecreated` field (CORRECT)

## Root Cause
During Bug 2 implementation, the field name was correctly changed from `timeaccessed` to `timecreated` in the database schema and most functions. However, a duplicate logging function remained that still used the old field name.

## Fix Applied
- **REMOVED** the first (incorrect) function that used `timeaccessed`
- **KEPT** the second (correct) function that uses `timecreated`
- **VERIFIED** no other references to `timeaccessed` exist in the codebase

## Impact
- ✅ API calls will now be properly logged with correct field name
- ✅ Monitoring dashboards will show accurate API usage data
- ✅ No more database field mismatch errors
- ✅ Consistent with Bug 2 fix implementation

## Files Modified
- `local/local_alx_report_api/lib.php` - Removed duplicate function

## Verification
- ✅ PHP syntax check passed
- ✅ No remaining `timeaccessed` references found
- ✅ All `timecreated` references are consistent
- ✅ Single logging function remains with correct field name

## Status: COMPLETE ✅
The API logging issue has been resolved. All API calls will now be properly tracked in the monitoring dashboards.
