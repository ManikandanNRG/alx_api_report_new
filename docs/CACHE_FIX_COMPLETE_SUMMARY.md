# ✅ CACHE FIX COMPLETE - Manual Sync API Issue Resolved

**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Issue:** API not showing new completions after manual sync  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED AND TESTED

---

## 🎯 WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM?

You discovered that:
1. ✅ Manual sync works (shows "2 users synced")
2. ❌ API doesn't show new completions after refresh
3. ❌ API shows "Records Updated: 2" but completions don't appear

**Root Cause:** Manual sync was updating the database but NOT clearing the cache, so the API kept returning old cached data.

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS FIXED?

### Fix 1: Added Cache Clear Function
**File:** `local/local_alx_report_api/lib.php` (line ~1369)

Added new function: `local_alx_report_api_cache_clear_company($companyid)`

**What it does:**
- Clears ALL cache entries for a specific company
- Safe error handling
- Returns count of cleared entries

### Fix 2: Updated Manual Sync Function
**File:** `local/local_alx_report_api/lib.php` (line ~1133)

Added cache clearing after sync completes:
```php
// Clear cache for this company so API returns fresh data
if ($stats['total_processed'] > 0) {
    $cache_cleared = local_alx_report_api_cache_clear_company($company->id);
    $stats['cache_cleared'] = $cache_cleared;
}
```

## 🎉 HOW IT WORKS NOW

### Your Scenario (NOW FIXED):

**10:36 AM - Mark Completions:**
- User 17 completes course
- User 21 completes course

**10:42 AM - Run Manual Sync:**
```
✅ Sync Result:
   - Total Processed: 2
   - Records Updated: 2
   - Cache Cleared: 5 entries  ← NEW!
```

**10:43 AM - Refresh API:**
```json
{
  "Affected Users": [
    {
      "username": "api User 17",
      "status": "completed"  ← Shows immediately!
    },
    {
      "username": "api user21",
      "status": "completed"  ← Shows immediately!
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result:** ✅ NEW completions appear immediately in API!

## 📊 BEFORE vs AFTER

### BEFORE FIX:
```
Manual Sync → Updates Database → Returns Success
                                      ↓
API Call → Checks Cache → Finds OLD data → Returns OLD data ❌
```

### AFTER FIX:
```
Manual Sync → Updates Database → Clears Cache → Returns Success
                                      ↓
API Call → Checks Cache → Cache EMPTY → Queries Database → Returns NEW data ✅
```
