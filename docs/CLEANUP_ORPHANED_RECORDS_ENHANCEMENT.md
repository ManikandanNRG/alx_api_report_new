## 🔧 WHAT WAS CHANGED

### File: sync_reporting_data.php

**Section 1: Enhanced Cleanup Logic (Line ~205)**

**Before:**
```php
$orphaned = $DB->get_records_sql($sql, $params);
foreach ($orphaned as $record) {
    $DB->set_field(..., 'is_deleted', 1, ['id' => $record->id]);
    $deleted_count++;
}
```

**After:**
```php
// Get DETAILED information before deleting
$sql = "SELECT r.id, r.userid, r.courseid, r.companyid,
               u.firstname, u.lastname, u.email,
               c.fullname as coursename,
               comp.name as companyname
        FROM {local_alx_api_reporting} r
        LEFT JOIN {user} u ON u.id = r.userid
        LEFT JOIN {course} c ON c.id = r.courseid
        LEFT JOIN {company} comp ON comp.id = r.companyid
        WHERE cu.id IS NULL AND r.is_deleted = 0";

$orphaned = $DB->get_records_sql($sql, $params);

// Track details for display
$sync_details['deleted_users'] = [];
$sync_details['deleted_by_company'] = [];
$sync_details['deleted_courses'] = [];

foreach ($orphaned as $record) {
    // Mark as deleted
    $DB->set_field(...);
    
    // Track user, company, course details
    // ... (detailed tracking code)
}
```

**Section 2: Added Results Display (Line ~251)**

**Before:**
```php
if ($action !== 'cleanup') {
    // Show results only for sync actions
}
// Cleanup had NO results display!
```

**After:**
```php
if ($action === 'cleanup') {
    // Show cleanup-specific results
    // - Company info card
    // - Statistics card
    // - Deleted by company table
    // - Affected courses table
    // - Affected users table
    // - Clean database message
} else if ($action !== 'cleanup') {
    // Show sync results
}
```

## 📝 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### SQL Query Enhancement:

**Before:**
```sql
SELECT r.id FROM {local_alx_api_reporting} r
LEFT JOIN {company_users} cu ON ...
WHERE cu.id IS NULL
```

**After:**
```sql
SELECT r.id, r.userid, r.courseid, r.companyid,
       u.firstname, u.lastname, u.email,
       c.fullname as coursename,
       comp.name as companyname
FROM {local_alx_api_reporting} r
LEFT JOIN {company_users} cu ON ...
LEFT JOIN {user} u ON u.id = r.userid
LEFT JOIN {course} c ON c.id = r.courseid
LEFT JOIN {company} comp ON comp.id = r.companyid
WHERE cu.id IS NULL
```

**Why:** Collects all necessary information in one query for display

### Data Structures:

```php
$sync_details['deleted_users'] = [
    userid => {
        userid, firstname, lastname, email, record_count
    }
];

$sync_details['deleted_by_company'] = [
    companyid => {
        companyid, companyname, count
    }
];

$sync_details['deleted_courses'] = [
    courseid => {
        courseid, fullname, record_count
    }
];
```
