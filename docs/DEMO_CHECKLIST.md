- What other bugs did you find?
- When can we deploy to production?
- What's the risk level?
- Do we need more testing?
- What resources do you need?

### Closing (2 min)
"I'm confident we can have this production-ready in 2-3 weeks. The core functionality is solid, we just need to polish the edges. What would you like me to prioritize?"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è POTENTIAL QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### Q: "Why weren't these bugs caught earlier?"
**A:** "This is the first comprehensive review. The plugin was developed iteratively, and these issues emerged as we integrated all components. I've now documented everything and have a clear fix plan."

### Q: "How confident are you in the timeline?"
**A:** "Very confident. The critical issues are fixed. The remaining work is well-understood and documented. I've built in buffer time for testing."

### Q: "What if we find more bugs?"
**A:** "I've created a systematic testing process. Any new issues will be documented, prioritized, and added to the timeline. The architecture is solid, so fixes should be straightforward."

### Q: "Can we deploy to production now?"
**A:** "We can deploy the core functionality, but I recommend waiting 1 week to complete high-priority fixes. This ensures a smooth production experience."

### Q: "What's the biggest risk?"
**A:** "The biggest risk is rushing to production before completing high-priority fixes. With 1-2 more weeks of work, we'll have a very stable, production-ready system."

### Q: "Do you need help?"
**A:** "The work is manageable solo, but code review would be valuable. Also, having someone test the API from Power BI's perspective would help ensure we meet their needs."
