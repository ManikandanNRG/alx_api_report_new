# Course ID to Username Replacement - Version 1.7.0

## 📋 **Original Requirement**

**User Request:** Replace "Course ID" field with "Username" field in API responses

**From the image provided:**
- API Field Controls section shows: User ID, First Name, Last Name, Email, **Course ID**, Course Name, etc.
- **Requirement:** Replace "Course ID" checkbox with "Username" checkbox

## 🎯 **What This Means**

### **BEFORE (Current State):**
```json
{
  "userid": 123,
  "firstname": "John",
  "lastname": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "courseid": 456,          // ← This field
  "coursename": "Math 101",
  "percentage": 85.5,
  "status": "completed"
}
```

### **AFTER (Required State):**
```json
{
  "userid": 123,
  "firstname": "John",
  "lastname": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "username": "johndoe",    // ← Replace with this
  "coursename": "Math 101",
  "percentage": 85.5,
  "status": "completed"
}
```

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL CLARIFICATION**

### **The Confusion:**

I initially said "replace courseid with username" which could mean:

**Option A: Replace in API Response ONLY** (What I implemented)
- Database still has `courseid` field
- Database adds `username` field
- API returns `username` instead of `courseid`
- Both fields exist in database

**Option B: Replace EVERYWHERE** (What you expected)
- Remove `courseid` from database
- Replace with `username` field
- API returns `username`
- Only `username` exists

### **What I Actually Did:**
✅ Added `username` field to database (alongside `courseid`)
✅ Changed API response to return `username` instead of `courseid`
❌ Did NOT remove `courseid` from database
❌ SQL queries still select `courseid` (but don't return it in API)

### **What You Expected:**
- Complete replacement of `courseid` with `username`
- Remove `courseid` from everywhere

## 🔍 **Current Implementation Status**

### **✅ Completed:**
1. **Database Schema:**
   - Added `username` field to `local_alx_api_reporting` table
   - `courseid` field still exists

2. **API Response Structure:**
   - Changed from `courseid` to `username` in return structure
   - Field settings changed from `field_courseid` to `field_username`

3. **Data Population:**
   - SQL queries fetch `u.username` from user table
   - Reporting records store `username` value

### **❌ Issues Found:**
1. **SQL queries still select `c.id as courseid`** in fallback function
2. **Database still has `courseid` field** (not removed)
3. **Unclear if `courseid` should be completely removed**

## 🎯 **Clarified Requirement - Please Confirm**

### **Question 1: Database Field**
Should `courseid` field be:
- **Option A:** Kept in database (for relationships/unique keys) but not returned in API
- **Option B:** Completely removed from database and replaced with username

### **Question 2: SQL Queries**
Should SQL queries:
- **Option A:** Still select `courseid` for internal use but not return it
- **Option B:** Remove `c.id as courseid` from all SELECT statements

### **Question 3: Unique Key**
The reporting table has unique key: `(userid, courseid, companyid)`
- **Option A:** Keep this unique key as is
- **Option B:** Change to `(userid, username, companyid)` - **This could cause issues!**

## 💡 **My Recommendation**

**Keep `courseid` in database, remove from API response:**

**Reasons:**
1. **Database Relationships:** `courseid` is needed for joins with course table
2. **Unique Keys:** `(userid, courseid, companyid)` ensures one record per user per course
3. **Performance:** Filtering by `courseid` (integer) is faster than `username` (string)
4. **Data Integrity:** Course ID is the primary key, username can change

**What to do:**
- ✅ Keep `courseid` in database
- ✅ Add `username` field to database
- ✅ Return `username` in API (not `courseid`)
- ✅ Remove `c.id as courseid` from SQL SELECT (since we don't use it)

## 📝 **Remaining Work**

### **If we keep courseid in database (Recommended):**
1. Remove `c.id as courseid` from fallback SQL query (not needed in response)
2. Test API response to ensure only `username` is returned
3. Update any UI that shows field options

### **If we remove courseid completely (Not Recommended):**
1. Remove `courseid` field from database schema
2. Change unique key to use username
3. Update all SQL queries to not use courseid
4. Risk: Performance issues, data integrity problems

## ✅ **Next Steps**

**Please confirm:**
1. Should we keep `courseid` in database? (Recommended: YES)
2. Should we remove `c.id as courseid` from SQL SELECT? (Recommended: YES)
3. Are you okay with the current implementation where API returns `username` but database still has `courseid`?

Once confirmed, I will:
1. Complete the remaining cleanup
2. Test the implementation
3. Document the final state
