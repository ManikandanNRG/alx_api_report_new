## 📊 **Alert Severity Threshold - Complete Explanation**

### **What is Alert Severity?**

Your plugin monitors the system and generates alerts when issues occur. Each alert has a **severity level** that indicates how urgent it is.

---

### **The 4 Severity Levels:**

#### **🟢 LOW Severity (Informational)**

**What triggers LOW alerts:**
- User approaching rate limit (80-90% used)
- Minor performance slowdown (response time 1-2 seconds)
- Cache hit rate below 70%
- Non-critical system warnings
- Database queries slightly slower than normal

**Example Alert:**
> "User john@company.com has used 85 of 100 daily API calls"

**Impact:** Informational only, no immediate action needed

**When to use:** Development/testing environments where you want to see everything

---

#### **🟡 MEDIUM Severity (Warning)**

**What triggers MEDIUM alerts:**
- User exceeded rate limit (but not by much)
- Authentication failures (1-5 failed attempts)
- Response time 2-5 seconds
- Database queries taking longer than normal
- System health score 70-85%
- Cache system issues

**Example Alert:**
> "User john@company.com exceeded rate limit: 105/100 requests today"

**Impact:** Should be reviewed, but not urgent. Can wait until business hours.

**When to use:** **RECOMMENDED for production** - Catches important issues without alert fatigue

---

#### **🟠 HIGH Severity (Urgent)**

**What triggers HIGH alerts:**
- Multiple users exceeding rate limits simultaneously
- Repeated authentication failures (5-10 attempts from same IP)
- Response time > 5 seconds consistently
- Database performance degraded significantly
- System health score 50-70%
- API error rate > 10%
- Multiple simultaneous issues

**Example Alert:**
> "URGENT: 5 users exceeded rate limits in the last hour. Possible system issue or attack."

**Impact:** Requires attention soon. Should be addressed within hours.

**When to use:** Production systems where you only want to know about serious problems

---

#### **🔴 CRITICAL Severity (Emergency)**

**What triggers CRITICAL alerts:**
- System-wide rate limit violations (many users affected)
- Security breach attempts (10+ failed authentication attempts)
- API completely down or timing out
- Database connection failures
- System health score < 50%
- Multiple simultaneous critical issues
- Data integrity problems

**Example Alert:**
> "🚨 CRITICAL: API system health at 35%. Database response time >10 seconds. Immediate action required!"

**Impact:** **URGENT** - Immediate action required! System may be down or compromised.

**When to use:** Critical production systems where you only want emergency notifications

---

### **How Threshold Filtering Works:**

**Threshold = "Low" (🟢):**
```
✅ LOW alerts     → Sent (informational)
✅ MEDIUM alerts  → Sent (warnings)
✅ HIGH alerts    → Sent (urgent)
✅ CRITICAL alerts → Sent (emergency)

Result: You receive ALL alerts (can be noisy!)
```

**Threshold = "Medium" (🟡) - RECOMMENDED:**
```
❌ LOW alerts     → Filtered out
✅ MEDIUM alerts  → Sent (warnings)
✅ HIGH alerts    → Sent (urgent)
✅ CRITICAL alerts → Sent (emergency)

Result: You receive important alerts only (balanced)
```

**Threshold = "High" (🟠):**
```
❌ LOW alerts     → Filtered out
❌ MEDIUM alerts  → Filtered out
✅ HIGH alerts    → Sent (urgent)
✅ CRITICAL alerts → Sent (emergency)

Result: You receive only urgent/critical alerts (minimal emails)
```

**Threshold = "Critical" (🔴):**
```
❌ LOW alerts     → Filtered out
❌ MEDIUM alerts  → Filtered out
❌ HIGH alerts    → Filtered out
✅ CRITICAL alerts → Sent (emergency)

Result: You receive ONLY emergency alerts (very minimal)
```

---

### **Real-World Examples:**

#### **Scenario 1: Development Environment**
**Setting:** Threshold = "Low" (🟢)  
**Result:** You see everything - cache misses, slow queries, approaching limits  
**Benefit:** Full visibility for debugging and optimization

#### **Scenario 2: Production Environment (Recommended)**
**Setting:** Threshold = "Medium" (🟡)  
**Result:** You get notified of rate limit violations, auth failures, performance issues  
**Benefit:** Balanced - catches problems without overwhelming you with emails

#### **Scenario 3: Critical Production System**
**Setting:** Threshold = "High" (🟠) or "Critical" (🔴)  
**Result:** Only serious problems or emergencies  
**Benefit:** Minimal interruptions, only for real issues

## 🎨 **UI Changes:**

### **Before (Checkboxes):**
```
[✓] Allow GET Method
    ⚠️ Development/Testing Only

[✓] Enable Alert System
    Master switch for all alerts

[✓] Enable Email Alerts
    Send alerts via email
```

### **After (Toggle Switches):**
```
Allow GET Method                    [  ●──  ]
⚠️ Development/Testing Only

Enable Alert System                 [  ●──  ]
Master switch for all email alerts

(Enable Email Alerts removed - redundant)
```

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

### **Toggle Switch HTML:**
```html
<label class="toggle-switch">
    <input type="checkbox" name="allow_get_method" value="1">
    <span></span> <!-- Background track -->
    <span></span> <!-- Sliding circle -->
</label>
```

### **Toggle Switch CSS:**
```css
.toggle-switch input:checked + span {
    background-color: #667eea; /* Purple when ON */
}

.toggle-switch input:checked + span + span {
    transform: translateX(24px); /* Slide circle to right */
}
```
