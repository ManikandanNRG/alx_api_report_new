# ✅ Auto-Sync Tab Improvements - All Done!

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Added More Metrics (6 cards total)

**New Metrics Added:**
- 🕐 **Last Sync** - Shows when the last sync occurred (HH:MM format)

**After:** 00:00, 01:00, 02:00... 23:00 (round hours)

**Code Change:**
```php
// Generate round hour labels from 00:00 to 23:00
$hours = [];
for ($i = 0; $i < 24; $i++) {
    $hours[] = sprintf('%02d:00', $i);
}
```

### 3. ✅ Updated Company Sync Status Table Columns

**Old Columns (Removed):**

| Total Records | Total records for this company |
| Created Today | Records created today |
