# ALX Report API Plugin - Requirements Specification

## Introduction

The ALX Report API Plugin is a sophisticated Moodle local plugin that provides secure, high-performance API access to course progress data for external systems like Power BI, business intelligence platforms, and reporting dashboards. The plugin implements intelligent sync mechanisms, multi-tenant isolation, comprehensive monitoring, and enterprise-grade security features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Tenant API System

**User Story:** As a system administrator managing multiple companies/organizations, I want each company to have isolated API access with separate configurations, so that data privacy and customization requirements are met for each tenant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a company is configured THEN the system SHALL create isolated settings and data access for that company
2. WHEN an API request is made THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and determine their company association
3. WHEN data is returned THEN the system SHALL only include data belonging to the authenticated user's company
4. WHEN company settings are modified THEN the system SHALL only affect that specific company's API behavior
5. IF a user belongs to multiple companies THEN the system SHALL use the primary company association for API access

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Sync System

**User Story:** As a Power BI developer integrating with the API, I want the system to automatically optimize data transfer between full and incremental syncs, so that I get fast responses and minimal data transfer without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN it's the first API call for a company THEN the system SHALL perform a full sync and return all available data
2. WHEN the last sync failed THEN the system SHALL automatically perform a full sync to ensure data integrity
3. WHEN the time since last sync exceeds the configured window (default 24 hours) THEN the system SHALL perform a full sync
4. WHEN normal operation conditions are met THEN the system SHALL perform incremental sync returning only changed data
5. WHEN incremental sync returns no data THEN the system SHALL return an empty array with appropriate status messages
6. IF sync mode is set to "Always Incremental" THEN the system SHALL force incremental sync for every request
7. IF sync mode is set to "Always Full" THEN the system SHALL return complete dataset every time
8. IF sync mode is set to "Disabled" THEN the system SHALL work without sync status tracking

### Requirement 3: High-Performance Caching System

**User Story:** As a system administrator concerned about database performance, I want the API to implement intelligent caching mechanisms, so that repeated requests are served quickly without overloading the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API request is made THEN the system SHALL check for valid cached data before querying the database
2. WHEN cached data exists and is not expired THEN the system SHALL return cached data in under 50ms
3. WHEN cached data is expired or doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL query the database and cache the result
4. WHEN cache TTL is configured THEN the system SHALL respect the configured expiration time (default 1 hour)
5. WHEN cache storage exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL implement LRU eviction policy
6. IF caching is disabled THEN the system SHALL bypass cache and query database directly

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Security Framework

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the API to implement enterprise-grade security measures including authentication, rate limiting, and audit logging, so that the system is protected against abuse and unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API request is received THEN the system SHALL validate the authentication token
2. WHEN token validation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages and log the attempt
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL block requests and return rate limit error
4. WHEN security settings require POST-only THEN the system SHALL reject GET requests (except in development mode)
5. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL log all requests with timestamps, IP addresses, and response times
6. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL trigger security alerts
7. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL reject requests and require token renewal

### Requirement 5: Flexible Data Field Controls

**User Story:** As a company administrator, I want to control which data fields are included in API responses for my organization, so that I can meet privacy requirements and optimize payload sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN company field settings are configured THEN the system SHALL only include enabled fields in API responses
2. WHEN a field is disabled THEN the system SHALL exclude that field from all API responses for that company
3. WHEN field settings are not configured THEN the system SHALL use default field visibility settings
4. WHEN payload optimization is needed THEN companies SHALL be able to disable unused fields to reduce response size
5. IF privacy requirements exist THEN sensitive fields like email SHALL be easily disabled per company

### Requirement 6: Course-Level Access Control

**User Story:** As a company administrator, I want to control which courses are accessible via the API for my organization, so that only relevant training data is exposed to external systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN company course settings are configured THEN the system SHALL only return data for enabled courses
2. WHEN a course is disabled for a company THEN the system SHALL exclude all data related to that course
3. WHEN no course settings exist THEN the system SHALL auto-enable all courses assigned to the company
4. WHEN course assignments change THEN the system SHALL update available courses automatically
5. IF no courses are enabled THEN the system SHALL return empty results with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 7: Pre-Built Reporting Table System

**User Story:** As a system administrator managing large datasets, I want the system to maintain a pre-built reporting table with optimized data structures, so that API responses are fast even with thousands of users and courses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin is installed THEN the system SHALL create a reporting table with proper indexes
2. WHEN course progress data changes THEN the system SHALL update the reporting table incrementally
3. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL query the optimized reporting table instead of complex joins
4. WHEN data integrity is required THEN the system SHALL provide fallback to live data queries
5. WHEN reporting table is empty THEN the system SHALL populate it with historical data
6. IF reporting table becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL rebuild it automatically

### Requirement 8: Comprehensive Monitoring and Analytics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed monitoring dashboards and analytics to track API usage, performance, and system health, so that I can proactively manage the system and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN administrators access monitoring THEN the system SHALL provide real-time performance metrics
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL track response times, success rates, and error patterns
