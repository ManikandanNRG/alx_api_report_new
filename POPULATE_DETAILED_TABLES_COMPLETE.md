## üìä **Data Queries**

### **Company Stats Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    c.id,
    c.name,
    c.shortname,
    COUNT(DISTINCT r.userid) as total_users,
    COUNT(DISTINCT r.courseid) as active_courses,
    COUNT(r.id) as total_records,
    SUM(CASE WHEN r.created_at >= ? THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as records_created,
    SUM(CASE WHEN r.updated_at >= ? AND r.created_at < ? THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as records_updated
FROM {company} c
LEFT JOIN {local_alx_api_reporting} r ON r.companyid = c.id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name, c.shortname
HAVING COUNT(r.id) > 0
ORDER BY total_records DESC
```

### **Course Stats Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    c.id,
    c.fullname,
    COUNT(r.id) as total_changes,
    SUM(CASE WHEN r.created_at >= ? THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as records_created,
    SUM(CASE WHEN r.updated_at >= ? AND r.created_at < ? THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as records_updated
FROM {local_alx_api_reporting} r
JOIN {course} c ON c.id = r.courseid
GROUP BY c.id, c.fullname
HAVING COUNT(r.id) > 0
ORDER BY total_changes DESC
LIMIT 20
```

### **User Stats Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    u.id,
    u.firstname,
    u.lastname,
    u.email,
    COUNT(DISTINCT r.courseid) as courses_synced,
    SUM(CASE WHEN r.created_at >= ? THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as records_created,
    SUM(CASE WHEN r.updated_at >= ? AND r.created_at < ? THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as records_updated,
    CASE 
        WHEN SUM(CASE WHEN r.created_at >= ? THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0 THEN 'Created'
        ELSE 'Updated'
    END as status
FROM {user} u
JOIN {local_alx_api_reporting} r ON r.userid = u.id
GROUP BY u.id, u.firstname, u.lastname, u.email
ORDER BY courses_synced DESC, records_created DESC
LIMIT 50
```

## üîÑ **How It Works**

### **1. After Population Completes:**
- Summary stats are shown (Records Processed, Inserted, Companies, Duration)
- JavaScript `showCompletion()` function displays completion message
- Detailed results section is rendered below

### **2. Data Filtering:**
- If specific companies were selected: Shows only those companies
- If "All Companies" selected: Shows all companies with records
- Queries use `$start_time` to identify records created/updated during this population run

### **3. Empty States:**
- If no data available, shows friendly empty state message
- Uses dashed border and icon to indicate no data
- Prevents empty tables from displaying

---

## üì± **Responsive Design**

### **Company Cards:**
- Grid layout: `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(350px, 1fr))`
- Automatically adjusts to screen size
- Minimum card width: 350px

### **Tables:**
- Full width with proper column sizing
- Percentage-based widths for consistency
- Scrollable on small screens (handled by Moodle's responsive framework)
